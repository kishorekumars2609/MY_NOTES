Networking Learnings :

Network - a group of devices connected to each other (wired or wireless)
SERVER : AN Device that handel the data request, information , network services from other computers known as clients. all the data is stored in the server(some times data base)
INternet : is the collection of multiple networks that are connected to each other
>>>> for the different netowrk to communicate with eachother in the internet , we use the switch , router for connecting them .



IP : INTERNET PROTOCOL address , is an address given to all the computers in an network , without ip address an computer cannot connect to the internet
MAC ADDRESS (MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL) - unique identification address that are assigned to the interfaces, they cannot be modified , it is physical address

ROUTERS : are the devices the passes packets back and forth accross the network

DOMAIN : is refered  to as a group of computers that are addressed as a whole . DNS

OSI   &   TCP/IP : are the protocoles that are used

OSI layers : A - P - S - T - N - D - P
 osi layers is not used now , but it has influence in learning about the networking.

FPS - FRAME , PACKET , SEGMENT

in layer 4 : transport layer:
             
             DATA | L4 HEADER    [SEGMENT]         - THE L4 header will contain information about TCP OR UDP and PORT NO

in layer 3 : NAETWORK LAYER :
             
             DATA | L4 HEADER | L3 HEADER  [PACKET]   - THE L3 header holds the infromation about the IP ADDRESS , source and
                                              destination address.      

in layer 3 : DATA LINK LAYER :  [FRAMES]

             L2 TRAILER | DATA | L4 HEADER | L3 HEADER | l2 HEADER   -- the l2 header and
                                                                        trailer has the information about the MAC ADDRESSS . 

in layer 1 : the FRAMES ARE send over the eathernet cable or wireless network.                                        


1. application layer : here we do not directly link with the application it self , we use the ( http/https )
2. presentation layer  : convert the data from the application understandable format to the network understandable format.
3. session layer : create session for data transfer 

4.Transport layer : it adds an HEADER , it converts the large set of data into smaller segments ,this will help in reducing      the network problems.(transmission problem) . example... i am watching an yt video ... then if the data are send in an small segments in an order , then when an transmission problem occures for an particular segment , then the video will render for that part and then move on to the next segment of data.

3. Network layer : (PACKET) it adds an header (L3) to all the incoming segments . the network layer provides connectivity betweent end hosts on different netwok.
   ... provides logical addression (IP ADDRESS)
   ... provides path selection between the source and the destination 
   ... Routers are used in this layer 
2. DatalINK LAYER :(FRAME )(SWITCH is an example device) add HEADER AND TRAILER TO THE DATA .
   ..... provide node to node connectivity 
   .....  pc to switch , switch to router , router to router , router to switch , switch to pc or server.
   ..... defines how data should be formateed , so that the data can be send to the physical layer
1. Physical Layer :
     ....defines the physical charactersitics the medium used to transfer data.
     .. Digital bits are converted into electrical (wired connection)
     ... Digital bits are converted into radion signals (wireless connection )




An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses serve two main purposes: host or network interface identification and location addressing. They play a fundamental role in the functioning of the Internet and local networks.

IP addresses can be classified into two types:

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4): Expressed as four sets of numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6): A newer protocol designed to address the limitations of IPv4, expressed as a series of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

Uses of IP Addresses:

Host Identification:

Every device connected to a network, such as a computer, smartphone, printer, or server, is assigned a unique IP address. This address is used to identify the specific device on the network.
Network Routing:

IP addresses are crucial for routing data across networks. Routers use IP addresses to determine the best path for data packets to reach their destination.
Communication:

Devices use IP addresses to communicate with each other over a network. When you send a request to a website, for example, your device uses the destination IP address to route the request to the correct server.
Internet Connectivity:

To access the internet, your device is assigned an IP address by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This address is used for communication with servers on the internet.
Domain Name System (DNS):

The DNS translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses. This translation is necessary for your device to locate the server associated with a given domain.


///////////////
let me give an situation , i am using my laptop in my home using  my wifi . then my laptop will have an ip address , when i take my laptop to my office , will it create a new ip address for my laptop?
answer:
Yes, when you move your laptop from your home to your office and connect to a different network, your laptop will typically be assigned a new IP address by the network at your office. This process happens through DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), which automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
///////////////
Router IP Address:

Your home router has an IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1). This address is used to manage and configure the router.
Device IP Addresses:

Each device connected to the home network is assigned a unique IP address. For instance:
Computer: 192.168.1.2
Smartphone: 192.168.1.3
Printer: 192.168.1.4
Communication:

When your computer (192.168.1.2) wants to access a website (e.g., www.example.com), it sends a request to the router (192.168.1.1).
The router, in turn, forwards the request to the DNS server (e.g., 8.8.8.8) to resolve the domain name www.example.com into an IP address.
Once the IP address is obtained (e.g., 93.184.216.34), the router directs the request to the appropriate server on the internet.

IP address is layer 3 address ..(ROUTER USE THEM)
switch is layer 2 ... so they use the layer 2 address ... MAC address

                                  HUB VS SWITCH
       
       the CAM hold the MAC address of the devices that are connected to the switch

HUB - is also a device in layer 2 --- it is used before the Switch
SWITCH : layer 2 device : Data link layer ---- the switch has CAM (CONTENT ADDRESSABLE MEMORY) or SWITCHING TABLE -- it stores the details of all the ip addresses(devices) that are connected to the switch. ... LAYER 2 ADDRESS (datalink layer address .. with header and tail)
   example /..... there are 2 networks  having devices 1,2,3,4 .a network with switch and another network has a hub in it.
               ...... if device 1 wants to ping device 4 ... in switch network .. the ping packet from 1 is send to switch .. the switch send it to the device 4 ... has it has the CAM.
               ...... if device 1 wants to ping device 4 ... in HUB network ... the ping packet from 1 is send to hub ... the hub will send the packet to all the deives that are connected to it ..(2,3,4)... the device 4 will acknoledge the packet .. and the device 2,3 will ignore it ... then the device will send the replay ping message to hub .. again the hub will send the replay to all the other devices that are connected to it.. (1,2,3)

      therefore , hub is waste and we are using switch in layer 2.

CLI cmd : in switch : show mac-address-table

....Learn about the ARP MSG ........................................
        
        ARP request - is used to find the MAC ADDRESS


ok how does an switch learn the mac address of all the devices that are connected to it ? ... we use ping <destination ip address>  to start the msg .. where does the mac address stored or mentioned .... 
switch is level 2 .. so they only understnad the mac address... when we use the ping cmd using the desination ip address ... inside the network ... 
note : in the ip address .. there will be network address and host addresss....(ARP MESSAGE) the sender device 1 will use the broadcase address ... and send it to the switch .. this broad cast address .. send the search message of the ip address to all the deives .. the devices are found using the broadcast address.... and the mac address are stored in the CAM table.....

when device 1 send the msg through the broadcase address... the CAM table stores the mac address of the device 1... when the deice 4 respond for it ... then , in that time the CAM table stores the MAC addrss of the device 4.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

                                          ROUTER:
  Router is an layer 3 device... 
  
Note : switch is used to connect devices that are in the same network .... i.e ... in the IP address .. we check the network address and the host address .

so when i try to ping a devics that is in an different network (example soure : 1.1.1.2  to destination  : 23.23.23.224)... these 2 has different network address .... so to connect them we use router.
..................................ARP MESSAGE /....................
the router also has an table that stores the path to connect to other networks.....




////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////x
                  DNS: Domain Name System

now , when i enter ... www.youtube.com ... this is a name .. we should turn it into an ip address so that we can send the 

http request messsage from our device to the server of youtube (ip address of youtube server.)

FIREWALL : 


2 types: software firewall -host based firewall - for a particular host alone
         network-based firewall : combination of physical and software - it is placed between the router of the organisation and the public wifi . ( it is placed before the router .... so it is placed in the network layer)
the firewall are made perticularily for an organization to protect the data from external attacks.

these firewall are made up using the FIREWALL RULES : ( ACCESS CONTROL LIST ) : they look over that enters and leave the network
like the access control list looks for :  1/ ip address  ,
                                           2/ port  
                                           3/ protocol 
                                           4/ destination address .
                                           5/ PROGRAMS
                                           6/key words
                                           7/ domain names


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



HTTPS . HTTPS , SSL , TLS

Hypertext transfer protocol - protocol that is used to view web pages on the internet - the text that i enter to see in the internet is transfered to the public internet . so the text that i entered can be viewed by others - i enter the email , passoword , creditcard information - these data are vulnerable to the hackers.
               these data that i enter need to pass throught the public internet to reach the server . therfore it is not safe.

Secure hypertext transfer protocol - the secure http encrypts the data the is obtained by the http , and send that encrypted data or the hashed data over the internet to the destination server . as the data can not be read by the external parites . it is safe to enter sensetive informations.
    the https protects (encryptes the data) - the data by using one of two protocoles . 
                1 ///and one of that protocole is SSL.
                2 //// TLS - Transport layer security

SSL - Secure Socket Layer : --- it uses public key encryption to encrypt data ..... when i enter www.google.com .. the web browser on my computer asks for an ssl certificate to the web server , the server sends it and then acknoledgement takes place.... after this process.. the web server shares an PUBLIC KEY FOR ENCRYPTION.

TLS - Transport Layer Security --- latest protocol ... successor to ssl --- 
     -- it authenticates the SERVER
                             CLIENT
                             ENCRYPT THE DAta

  - Connects different networks and routes data between them based on IP addresses.
  - Makes decisions about the best path for forwarding data.
  - Can provide security features, such as Network Address Translation (NAT) and firewall capabilities.

- **Hub:**
  - Operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model.
  - Basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a LAN.
  - Broadcasts data to all connected devices, leading to a less efficient use of bandwidth.
  - Does not differentiate between devices and does not have the ability to manage traffic.

- **Switch:**
  - Operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
  - Connects devices in a LAN and uses MAC addresses to forward data only to the intended device.
  - More intelligent than a hub, providing better bandwidth utilization and reduced collisions.

- Anonymous FTP allows users to access and download files from a server without providing a username and password. It often uses the username "anonymous" or "ftp" and requires an email address as the password.

**11. Network:**
- A network is a collection of interconnected devices and systems that can communicate and share resources with each other.

**12. Subnet Mask:**
- A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that divides an IP address into network and host portions. It is used to identify the network to which an IP address belongs.

**13. TCP/IP Model:**
- The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is a networking architecture that defines a suite of protocols used for communication on the Internet.

**14. Difference between OSI Model and TCP/IP Model:**
- The OSI model has seven layers, while the TCP/IP model has four layers.
- The TCP/IP model's layers are Application, Transport, Internet, and Link, which correspond to the top four layers of the OSI model.

**15. UTP Cable:**
- UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cable is a type of networking cable that consists of pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together. It is commonly used in Ethernet networks.

**16. Maximum Length for a UTP Cable:**

- DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, facilitating the location of resources on the Internet.

**31. Domain vs. Workgroup:**
- A domain is a centralized network structure with a domain controller, while a workgroup is a decentralized peer-to-peer network without a central authority.

**32. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):**
- OSPF is a dynamic routing protocol used to exchange routing information within an autonomous system.

**33. Round Trip Time:**
- Round Trip Time (RTT) is the time it takes for a packet to travel from the source to the destination and back. It is a measure of network latency.

**34. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):**
- DHCP is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration information to devices on a network.
