Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes for organizing code. In C++, OOP is implemented using features like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Let's discuss each OOP concept in detail with a real-time example:

1. Class:
Definition: A class is a user-defined data type that represents a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of objects.
Real-time Example:
cpp
Copy code
// Class definition
class Car {
public:
    // Properties
    string brand;
    int year;
    
    // Behaviors
    void startEngine() {
        cout << "Engine started." << endl;
    }
};


2. Object:
Definition: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and encapsulates the data and behavior defined by the class.
Real-time Example:
cpp
Copy codex
// Creating objects
Car myCar;
myCar.brand = "Toyota";
myCar.year = 2022;
myCar.startEngine();
3. Encapsulation:
Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (properties) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It protects the internal details of the class from outside access.
Real-time Example:
cpp
Copy code
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;  // Encapsulated property

public:
    // Encapsulated behavior
    void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }
};
4. Inheritance:
Definition: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It promotes code reusability.
Real-time Example:
cpp
Copy code
// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "Animal is eating." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class inheriting from Animal
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Dog is barking." << endl;
    }
};
5. Polymorphism:
Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables code to work with objects of multiple types through a common interface.
Real-time Example:
cpp
Copy code
// Base class
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() {
        cout << "Drawing a shape." << endl;
    }
};

// Derived classes demonstrating polymorphism
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing a circle." << endl;
    }
};

class Square : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing a square." << endl;
    }
};
6. Abstraction:
Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object.
Real-time Example:
cpp
Copy code
// Abstract class
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};

// Concrete classes providing specific implementations
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing a circle." << endl;
    }
};

class Square : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing a square." << endl;
    }
};
These examples illustrate the key OOP concepts in C++. Remember that OOP provides a structured and modular approach to software development, promoting code organization, reusability, and maintainability.






STATIC member fucntion :

these member of the class can be accessed with the help of class namespace
and we dont need to create the object of the class. 
the static member function can only access the static member datao
of the class , they cannot use other data members

ACCESS SPECIFIER:

public : all can use it.
private : only this class can use it.
protected : this class and its child class can use it.

FRIEND class . it is like an sub-class with key wod FRIEND.
